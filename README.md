# Real Estate Chatbot with Intuitive UI/UX Design

## Project Overview
This project focuses on a **Real Estate Chatbot** designed to streamline property searches, enhance lead generation, and improve customer interactions for realtors. Built using **Botpress**, the chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and a user-friendly interface to create seamless interactions between users and the system.

As part of this project, I focused on designing an intuitive **UI/UX** that simplifies chatbot interactions while addressing the specific needs of realtors and their clients.
